React Anotations
let = block scope
const = read only 
var = function scope

Acessing object 
const person = {
  name: "Mosh",
  walk() {},
  talk() {}
};

person.talk();
const targetMember = "name";
person.name;
person[targetMember] = "John";


Arrow function
const square = (number) => {
    return number * number;
}

template literal
const color = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
const items = colors.maps(color => `<li>${color}</li>`);

object destructuring
const address = {
	street: '',
	city: '',
	country: ''
};

const {street: st, city, country } = address;

spread operator
//arrays
const first = [1,2,3];
const second = [4,5,6];
const combined = [...first, 'other item', ...second];

//objects
const first = {name : 'Mosh'};
const second = {job : 'Instructor'};
const combined = {...first, ...second, location: 'Australia'};

By defaut all classes are private, by add export before de class name
you allow other files to import this class. 
Classes should be put in modules folder to a better organization of your code
export Class YourClass {}
import {YourClass} from './yourclass';
you can also export a function
export function promote(){}
if you export something as defaut you don't need to use {} at the import sentence
export default YourClass(){}
import YourClass from './yourclass';


	JavaScript library.
	To configure the base react project: npm i -g crete-react-app
	A componente is a JavaScript class that has some state (data that we want to display when the component is render) and a render method(responsable
	to discribe what the UI should look), the render method will output a react element witch is a simple plan javacript object that maps to dom element
	
	to create a react app run: create-react-app "name"
	to run the app: npm start
	
	JSX is the pattern that we write html to Babel convert into simple JavaScript
	to log something on the console: console.log(element);
	to install bootstrap run on the console:npm i bootstrap@4.1.1
	
	JavaScript doesn't know how to interpret more than one tag int the return of render, so you need to emblend this on <React.Fragment>
	with className you apply styles to your css <button className="btn btn-secondary btn-sm">Increment</button>
	
	define styles inline:
        <span style={{ fontSize: 30 }} className="badge badge-primary m-2">
	
	define stype in variable:
		styles = {
			fontSize: 10,
			fontWeight: "bold"
		};

		render() {
			return (
				<React.Fragment>
				<span style={this.styles} className="badge badge-primary m-2">
				
		calling a function
        <span className={this.getBadgeClasses()}>{this.formatCount()}</span>
		
		list 
		<ul>
          {this.state.tags.map(tag => (
            <li>{tag}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
		
		'this' works depending on the situation
		obj.method( this ); this is a reference to obj
		function( this ); returns a reference to the windown object, but if the strict mode is enable, it will return undefined
			to have access in this scenario, we need to use a bind method
			
		functions in javascript are object, and the have properties and methods
		
		after change some state we need to tell react the something has changed and to update the dom, you need to use this.setState();
		
		passing a parameter to a function
		
          onClick={() => this.handleIncrement(product)}
		  
		  handleIncrement = product => {
			console.log(product);
			this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
		  };
	
	
	Every react component has a property clallded props, you can verify it by console.log('props', this.props) that includes all atributes passed
	by the parent component
	
	
	Passing content to the children component 
		<Counter key={counter.id} value={counter.value}>  <-- pass simply information
            <h4>Title</h4>  <-- childreen props
         </Counter>
	
	props -> information that is given to a component, and the data is read only, you can not change the value inside its component
	
	state -> data that is local or private to that componente
	
	the component that owns a piece of the state, should be the one modifying it. You can not modifie a component for it's childreen, it need
	to be done from where it was created
	
	const counters = [...this.state.counters]; -- clone all the object counters
	
	
	when you hava a component that only hava the render method and any state, you can convert it to a Stateless Functional Component, but you 
	can not use life cicle hooks inside them
	
	
	react has 3 main phases
	Mount 
		counstructor - called only once when a instance of a class is created. This part is a good oportunity to initialize props values
		render
		componentDidMount - called when the component is render to the dom, is the perfect place to make ajax call to a server to get data
	Update
		render
		componentDidUpdate - called after a component is update, that it means maybe we have new state or new props. In this case we can compare
			the new state with the old state, and the new props with the old props, that if changed whe can call a ajax to get new data from server
	UnMount
		componentWillUnmount - called just before one component is remove from the dom
